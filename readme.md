# A3DoD Studio Protection Bot

The A3DoD Studio Protection Bot is a powerful Discord bot designed to safeguard your community with a suite of moderation tools. It provides real-time protection against spam, unauthorized links, bot addition, and other potential disruptions, ensuring your Discord experience remains enjoyable and secure.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Protection**: Each event, such as antispam, antilinks, or role monitoring, can be finely tuned to the server's needs through our interactive dashboard panel.
- **Dashboard Panel**: A user-friendly web interface for managing bot settings and configurations without the need to edit code directly.
- **Whitelist Roles**: Specific roles can be whitelisted to bypass protection actions, granting flexibility to trusted users.
- **Detailed Logs**: All protection alerts are sent to a designated log channel in embeds for easy tracking and oversight.
- **Comprehensive Event Handling**: From antiban to antispam, each script is dedicated to safeguarding a particular aspect of server life.

## Features

**Event Handlers:**

- `antibanmembers.js`: Monitors and takes action against users who ban members excessively.
- `antibots.js`: Prevents unauthorized bots from joining the server and takes action against the inviter.
- `antieditrole.js`: Tracks and restricts excessive editing of role permissions and details.
- `antieditserver.js`: Guards against and mitigates rapid server setting changes.
- `antikickmembers.js`: Detects and responds to users who kick members excessively.
- `antilinks.js`: Filters out unwanted links posted in the server and takes appropriate measures.
- `antispam.js`: Keeps channels clean by managing and removing spam messages.
- `channels.js`: Supervises channel creation and deletion, preventing channel spam.
- `roles.js`: Oversees the creation and deletion of roles within the server.

Each event handler is fine-tuned to respond effectively to various moderation challenges, configured to respect server-specific settings such as whitelisted roles and action thresholds through the dashboard panel.
